1) Size of the destination buffer should be greater than the number of bytes you want to copy.
2) The memory of source and destination buffer should not be overlap.
3) memcpy does not check the terminating null character, so carefully using with strings.
4) The behavior of memcpy can be undefined if you try to access the destination and source buffer beyond their length.
5) memcpy does not check the validity of the destination buffer.
6) memcpy does not check the validity of the source buffer.

The first Case if sizef of bytes greater than size of dest That will return This Error; 
// main.c:34:5: warning: 'memcpy' will always overflow; destination buffer has size 7, but size
//       argument is 10 [-Wbuiltin-memcpy-chk-size]
//     memcpy(dst, src, 10);
